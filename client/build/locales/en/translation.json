  "Intro": "The Framework Prof-XXI was created to guide HEIs in the design and implementation of TLCs for the 21st century. The Prof-XXI framework proposes a set of competences that HEIs can take as a reference to develop the actions and strategies of their TLCs. The Prof-XXI framework organizes these competences into 5 levels and 5 dimensions that interrelate to define a total of 50 competences."
